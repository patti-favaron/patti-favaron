- 👋 Hi, I’m @patti-favaron
- 👀 I’m an applied mathematician and programmer, with research interests in PBL meteorology, climatology and dispersion modeling. I'm member of AISAM, IEEE and IEEE-WIE.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things, with emphasis on open data, machine learning and parallel computing (mainly in Fortran); I'm very interested in Julia programming. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scientific data processing projects, and willing to welcome people to collaborate with me on my repositories and projects.
- 🐣 I understand which rarity young female developers are, and the value of their contribution, so, if you are one, you may ask me for mentoring and ideas.
- 📫 You may reach me by e-mail, at patti.favaron@gmail.com
